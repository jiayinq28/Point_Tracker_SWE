This point tracker was developed to support the work of the University of Michigan’s Society of Women Engineers (SWE). 
Users can update an input file with current member uniquenames, while the program accepts a list of participant uniquenames 
through terminal input. This tool is designed to streamline point tracking and reduce administrative workload for current 
and future SWE board members, and it can be easily adapted for use by other student organizations!

You can either download the code to run it locally or run it in the github codespaces.
To run the code, please follow these instructions:
- update member_uniquenames.txt
- type "make" in the terminal  -- (this compiles the code)
- type "./point_tracker"   -- (this runs the code)
- enter the list of participant uniquenames
- you're done! :))

Please feel free to contact me at guona@umich.edu if you have any suggestions for improving this code!
